This section helps you getting your extension ready to share with your team or the whole world of Visual Studio users.

## [Check the checklist](#check-the-checklist)
Make sure to check out [the checklist](checklist.html) to ensure your extension follows best practices before you share it with anyone.

## [Publish to the Marketplace](#publish-to-the-marketplace)
Share your fantastic extension with the world, but publishing it to the [Marketplace](marketplace.html).

## [Automate publishing with CI/CD](#automate-publishing-with-cicd)
Set up [automated publishing](automated-publishing.html) with GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines so every tagged release gets published to the Marketplace automatically.

## [Publish on a private gallery](#publish-on-a-private-gallery)
You can also [host your own gallery](private-galleries.html) of extensions using Atom feeds - either internally in your organization or on any web host. Register feeds manually or automatically from your extension.
